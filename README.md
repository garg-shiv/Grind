# 📚 Grind - 5 Week Study Journey

Welcome to my comprehensive study repository! This is a dedicated space where I'm diving deep into three critical areas of computer science and software development.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as my personal learning hub for an intensive 5-week study program. It contains lecture notes, code implementations, problem solutions, and experiments across multiple domains.

## 📖 Study Areas

### 🤖 **AI** (`/ai`)
Exploring artificial intelligence concepts, machine learning fundamentals, algorithms, and practical implementations. Building understanding from theory to application.

### 🔧 **Backend** (`/backend`)
Deep dive into backend development, server architecture, APIs, databases, and core backend technologies. Mastering the art of building robust server-side systems.

### 💻 **DSA** (`/dsa`)
Data Structures and Algorithms - the foundation of efficient programming. Solving LeetCode problems, implementing classic algorithms, and strengthening problem-solving skills.

### 📝 **Notes** (`/notes`)
Comprehensive notes, summaries, and key takeaways from the learning journey.

## 📅 Duration

**Timeline:** 5 weeks of dedicated, in-depth learning and implementation

## 🚀 How to Use This Repo

- Each folder is organized by topic
- Code files contain solutions, implementations, and experiments
- Notes folder contains key concepts and learnings
- All code is documented for easy reference and understanding

## 💡 Learning Approach

- **Consistency:** Daily practice and learning
